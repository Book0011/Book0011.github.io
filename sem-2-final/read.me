For this site I wanted to create something unique that demonstrated my previous work experience and my journey towards becoming
a digital marketer. I really liked the idea of having a cool interective feature like to text animation, and it took me while to figure
out how to use it, but once i got it, it made sense and wasn't  as confusing. I'm glad I learned how to do it!
