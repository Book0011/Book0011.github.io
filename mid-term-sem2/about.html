            <h3 class="who">Who</h3>
            <p class="who-t">is ARC? We are the Athletics & Recreation Centre. This is an exciting venture for our Algonquin
                Community.
                This facility will provide our students with a place to break through perceptual barriers in a
                welcoming,
                safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures and abilities to
                spark a
                movement.</p>
            <h3 class="what">What</h3>
            <p class="what-t">is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your activity fee. All fee-paying students
                can
                use and participate in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will cost Algonquin
                College
                $48.8 million.</p>
            <h3 class="where">Where</h3>
            <p class="where-t">will the ARC building be? The ARC building will be located northeast of the Student Commons building,
                opposite
                of the residence. The facility will be an estimated 100,000 square feet! Connected to the Student
                Commons by a
                "Plus 15" Pedestrian Link. </p>
